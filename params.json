{"name":"JGraLab","tagline":"The Java Graph Laboratory","body":"# Welcome!\r\n\r\nJGraLab is a high-performance Java graph library and modeling framework\r\nimplementing so-called TGraphs: typed,\r\nattributed, ordered, and directed graphs.  Beyond the plain data structure, the\r\nlibrary contains an extensive algorithm library, the graph query language\r\nGReQL, the transformation API GReTL, and tons of utilities.\r\n\r\nCurrent build status: [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jgralab/jgralab.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jgralab/jgralab)\r\n\r\n## Installation and Building\r\n\r\n### Building from Sources\r\n\r\nThe `jgralab` project depends on the `common` project.  It is important that\r\nthey reside next to each other on your filesystem.  For example, clone both\r\nprojects into some base folder `jgsrc` so that the filesystem structure is like\r\nso.\r\n\r\n    jgsrc/               # your jgralab workspace\r\n    +-> jgralab/         # this project, i.e., jgralab itself\r\n\r\nTo build `jgralab` you need to have [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/).\r\nBuild `jgralab`.\r\n\r\n    $ cd jgsrc/jgralab/\r\n    $ ant\r\n\r\nThe `jgralab` project contains an Eclipse `.project` and `.classpath` file, so that you\r\ncan import it in Eclipse as existing project.\r\n\r\n### Getting Releases via Maven or Leiningen\r\n\r\nThe current and past JGraLab releases are pushed to\r\n[the JGraLab Clojars site](http://clojars.org/de.uni-koblenz.ist/jgralab) so\r\nthat you can fetch them easily as project dependency via the\r\n[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) or [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) build\r\nand project management systems.\r\n\r\n### Downloading a Pre-Compiled Jar\r\n\r\nYou can download nightly builds from our\r\n[snapshots page](http://userpages.uni-koblenz.de/~ist/jgralab/snapshots/).  The\r\nsource jars contain the compiled class files and the source files.  As such,\r\nthey are preferable to the binary-only builds when you intend to develop\r\napplications using JGraLab, because then you get nicer code completion, e.g.,\r\nthe real names of method parameters instead of just `arg0`.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n### API Documentation\r\n\r\nYou can find the API documentation for the current JGraLab master branch at our\r\n[API Docs Page](http://userpages.uni-koblenz.de/~ist/jgralab/api/).  This\r\ndocumentation is regenerated every night.\r\n\r\n### Coverage Report\r\n\r\nEvery night, we run all our test cases against the current master branch and\r\nmeasure our coverage using\r\n[Atlassian Clover](http://www.atlassian.com/software/clover/overview).  The\r\nresults are accessible at our\r\n[Coverage Report Page](http://userpages.uni-koblenz.de/~ist/jgralab/clover-report/).\r\n\r\n### Tutorials and Getting Started\r\n\r\nWe've started writing a tutorial in the\r\n[JGraLab Wiki](http://github.com/jgralab/jgralab/wiki).  It's not yet\r\ncomplete, but we'll keep working on extending it.\r\n\r\n### Getting Help\r\n\r\nJoin us on the official [JGraLab IRC Channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/#jgralab)\r\n(channel `#jgralab` on `irc.freenode.net`).  If you don't have or don't want to\r\ninstall an IRC client, you can also\r\n[chat directly in your browser](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=jgralab).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2006-2013 The JGraLab Team <ist@uni-koblenz.de>\r\n\r\nDistributed under the General Public License (Version 3), with the following\r\nadditional grant:\r\n\r\n    Additional permission under GNU GPL version 3 section 7\r\n\r\n    If you modify this Program, or any covered work, by linking or combining it\r\n    with Eclipse (or a modified version of that program or an Eclipse plugin),\r\n    containing parts covered by the terms of the Eclipse Public License (EPL),\r\n    the licensors of this Program grant you additional permission to convey the\r\n    resulting work.
