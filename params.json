Beyond the plain data structure, the\r\nlibrary contains an extensive algorithm library, the graph query language\r\nGReQL, the transformation API GReTL, and tons of utilities.\r\n\r\n## Installation and Building\r\n\r\n### Building from Sources\r\n\r\nThe following assumes that you create (or use) a workspace folder `jgsrc` for JGraLab \r\nand your JGraLab applications. Name and location of that workspace can be arbitrarily\r\nchosen.\r\n\r\nWhen you plan to use Eclipse as IDE, the easiest is to put the `jgralab` folder into\r\nyour Eclipse workspace folder.\r\n\r\nThe Ant build scripts require that your applications are located\r\nin sibling folders next to `jgralab`.\r\n\r\n    jgsrc/               # your jgralab workspace\r\n    +-> jgralab/         # this project, i.e., jgralab itself\r\n    +-> mygraphproject   # your app has to sit next to jgralab\r\n    \r\nTo build `jgralab` you need to have [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/).\r\nBuild `jgralab`.\r\n\r\n    $ cd jgsrc/jgralab/\r\n    $ ant\r\n\r\nThe `jgralab` folder contains an Eclipse `.project` and `.classpath` file, so that you\r\ncan import it in Eclipse as existing project. This import step is necessary also when\r\nyou initially decided to put JGraLab into the Eclipse workspace since\r\nEclipse does not automatically scan its workspace for new projects.\r\n\r\nJGRaLab's Ant build generates many source files. Each time you run `ant`, you have\r\nto refresh the project in Eclipse, so that the changes get reflected in the IDE. \r\n\r\n### Getting Releases via Maven or Leiningen\r\n\r\nThe current and past JGraLab releases are pushed to\r\n[the JGraLab Clojars site](https://clojars.org/de.uni-koblenz.ist/jgralab) so\r\nthat you can fetch them easily as project dependency via the\r\n[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) or [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) build\r\nand project management systems.\r\n\r\n### Downloading a Pre-Compiled Jar\r\n\r\nYou can download nightly builds from our\r\n[snapshots page](http://userpages.uni-koblenz.de/~ist/jgralab/snapshots/).  The\r\nsource jars contain the compiled class files and the source files.  As such,\r\nthey are preferrable to the binary-only builds when you intend to develop\r\napplications using JGraLab, because then you get nicer code completion, e.g.,\r\nthe real names of method parameters instead of just `arg0`.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n### API Documentation\r\n\r\nYou can find the API documentation for the current JGraLab master branch at our\r\n[API Docs Page](http://userpages.uni-koblenz.de/~ist/jgralab/api/).  This\r\ndocumentation is regenerated every night.\r\n\r\n### Coverage Report\r\n\r\nEvery night, we run all our test cases against the current master branch and\r\nmeasure our coverage using\r\n[Atlassian Clover](http://www.atlassian.com/software/clover/overview).  The\r\nresults are accessible at our\r\n[Coverage Report Page](http://userpages.uni-koblenz.de/~ist/jgralab/clover-report/).\r\n\r\n### Tutorials and Getting Started\r\n\r\nWe've started writing a tutorial in the\r\n[JGraLab Wiki](https://github.com/jgralab/jgralab/wiki).  It's not yet\r\ncomplete, but we'll keep working on extending it.\r\n\r\n### Getting Help\r\n\r\nJoin us on the official [JGraLab IRC Channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/#jgralab)\r\n(channel `#jgralab` on `irc.freenode.net`).  If you don't have or don't want to\r\ninstall an IRC client, you can also\r\n[chat directly in your browser](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=jgralab).\r\n\r\n## Publications\r\n\r\n  - _GReTL: an extensible, operational, graph-based transformation language_,\r\n    Jürgen Ebert and Tassilo Horn, In: Software and Systems Modeling, 2012,\r\n    http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10270-012-0250-3\r\n  - _The GReTL Transformation Language_, Tassilo Horn and Jürgen Ebert, In:\r\n    Theory and Practice of Model Transformations - 4th International\r\n    Conference, ICMT 2011, http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-21732-6_11\r\n  - _Solving the TTC 2011 Compiler Optimization Case with GReTL_, Tassilo Horn,\r\n    TTC 2011, http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4745v1\r\n  - _Solving the TTC 2011 Reengineering Case with GReTL_, Tassilo Horn, TTC\r\n    2011, http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4747\r\n  - _Saying Hello World with GReTL - A Solution to the TTC 2011 Instructive\r\n    Case_, Tassilo Horn, TTC 2011, http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4762\r\n  - _Reverse Engineering Using Graph Queries_, Jürgen Ebert and Daniel\r\n    Bildhauer, In: Schürr, Andy; Lewerentz, Claus; Engels, Gregor; Schäfer,\r\n    Wilhelm; Westfechtel, Bernhard: Graph Transformations and Model Driven\r\n    Engineering, 2010, http://uni-koblenz.de/~ist/documents/Ebert2010REU.pdf\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2006-2014 The JGraLab Team <ist@uni-koblenz.de>\r\n\r\nDistributed under the\r\n[General Public License, Version 3](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) with\r\nthe following additional grant:\r\n\r\n    Additional permission under GNU GPL version 3 section 7\r\n\r\n    If you modify this Program, or any covered work, by linking or combining it\r\n    with Eclipse (or a modified version of that program or an Eclipse plugin),\r\n    containing parts covered by the terms of the Eclipse Public License (EPL),\r\n    the licensors of this Program grant you additional permission to convey the\r\n    resulting work.
