/**
 * This test suite runs all instance tests provided by JGraLab. By default the
 * database implementation is not tested. If it should be tested, the following
 * system properties have to be specified:
 * 
 * - dbaddress (address of the database server e.g.:
 * "postgresql://localhost:5432/") - dbname (name of the database e.g.:
 * "jgralabtest" - user (username using the database) - password (password for
 * the database)
 * 
 * The database with the given name has to be created for the given user.
 * Furthermore the generic database schema has to be created in the database.
 * This can be done by running the main method of the class
 * <code>GraphDatabaseHandler</code> with the same set of system properties
 * shown above.
