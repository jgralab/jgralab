/**
 * This class can be used to "colorize" graphs, edges and vertices. If a
 * algorithm only needs to distinguish between "marked" and "not marked", a look
 * at the class <code>BooleanGraphMarker</code> may be reasonable. If a specific
 * kind of marking is used, it may be reasonalbe to extends this GraphMarker. A
 * example how that could be done is located in the tutorial in the class
 * <code>DijkstraVertexMarker</code>.
 * 
 * This Marker only exists for compatibility reasons to older versions of
 * JGraLab. The new marker class <code>GenericGraphMarker</code> allows a
 * stricter limitation to specific <code>AttributedElement</code>s.
